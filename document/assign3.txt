1 Component Diagram
1.1 Explanation of Componentization Strategy
For the Component Diagram, I have grouped the system classes into logical high-level
components based onFeature Domains. This aligns with the “Package by Feature” or
“Domain-Driven Design” (connected to Assignment 2’s Layered Architecture).
1.AuthComponent: Encapsulates all user identity, registration, and security logic
(UserService, JwtService). This is a foundational component required by all others.
2.MoodTrackingComponent: Handles the core student feature—logging and re-
trieving mood data (MoodService).
3.BurnoutAnalysisComponent: Contains the complex logic for analyzing student
data (BurnoutDetectionEngine and Strategies). Separating this allows the analysis
logic to evolve (e.g., adding ML) without touching the data logging components.
4.NotificationComponent: Abstraction for external communications. It uses the
Factory and Adapter patterns to hide the complexity of different providers (Twilio,
Firebase).
5.AdvisorComponent: Provides the interface for advisors to monitor student well-
ness.

Figure 1 illustrates the componentization strategy with dependencies between components.

2 Sequence Diagram
2.1 Use Case: High-Risk Mood Detection & Notification
This diagram models the flow where a student logs a generic mood entry that triggers
a burnout warning. It demonstrates the interaction between the Mood Component,
Analysis Component, and Notification Component.
•It highlights theObserver Pattern: MoodService (Subject) notifying Burnout-
DetectionEngine (Observer).
•It shows theStrategy Pattern: The Engine choosing a strategy to analyze data.
•It shows theFactory/Adapter Pattern: The Notification Service creating the
right adapter to send the alert.
2.2 Sequence Diagram
Figure 2 shows the interaction flow between system components when a high-risk mood is
detected.

3 Activity Diagram
3.1 Business Process: “Burnout Analysis & Intervention Work-
flow”
This diagram visualizes the complex decision-making process that occurs after a stu-
dent logs their mood. It is chosen because it involves parallel activities (Fork/Join) and
conditional logic that would be hard to capture in a sequence diagram.
•Decisions: Checking if the stress level exceeds the threshold.
•Parallelism (Fork): If risk is detected, the system simultaneously notifies the
advisor AND sends an immediate supportive message to the student, while also
logging the incident.
•Swimlanes: Clearly separate the responsibilities of the Student, the System (Back-
end), and the Advisor.
3.2 Activity Diagram
Figure 3 depicts the workflow with decision points, parallel activities, and swimlanes.

4 Architectural Style and Rationale
4.1 Architectural Style: Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
4.2 Rationale
We have chosen theLayered Architecturestyle for the MindMate system. This style
organizes the system into horizontal logical layers, where each layer has a specific role
and responsibility (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
1.Separation of Concerns & Maintainability: This style perfectly fits our project
needs because it enforces a strict separation of concerns. TheController Layerhandles
HTTP requests and JSON serialization but knows nothing about business rules. The
Service Layercontains all the complex business logic (like the Burnout Detection
strategies) but knows nothing about SQL or database connections. TheRepository
Layerhandles data persistence. This separation makes the system easier to maintain;
for example, we could switch the specialized BurnoutDetectionStrategy in the Service
Layer without changing a single line of code in the Controllers or Repositories.
2.Testability: The Layered Architecture directly supports our Non-Functional Require-
ment for high reliability through testing. Because the layers are decoupled (depen-
dency injection), we can unit test the Business Logic Layer in isolation by mocking
the Repository Layer. This is critical for our BurnoutDetectionEngine—we need to
verify it detects risks correctly without needing to spin up a real database or send real
SMS messages during every test run.

3.Relationship to Design Patterns (Assignment 2): This architecture provides
the “home” for the design patterns we implemented in Assignment 2:
•TheRepository Patternprovides the interface for the Data Access Layer, ab-
stracting the database.
•TheFactoryandStrategypatterns live within the Service Layer to encapsulate
complex business logic decisions.
•TheDTO (Data Transfer Object)pattern is used to pass data between the Pre-
sentation and Service layers, ensuring that internal database entities (like User
passwords) are never exposed directly to the API responses.
Summary
The Layered Architecture provides a robust, maintainable, and testable foundation
for the MindMate system, supporting all the design patterns implemented and
ensuring clear separation of concerns across the application.
